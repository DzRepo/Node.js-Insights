# Node scripts for working with [Gnip](http://www.gnip.com) Audience and Engagement APIs
See:  the Support web site sections on [Audience API](http://support.gnip.com/apis/audience_api/) and [Engagement API](http://support.gnip.com/apis/engagement_api/) for more information.

This is an early prototype, not a library, but it demonstrates how to properly call the Engagement API with Node.

##Insights.js
Test script to demonstrate calling into Engagement API.

Note that the application that was used to create the Consumer Key/Secret needs to be associated to your Gnip account.
This is done by sending in the URL ( https://apps.twitter.com/app/???????? ) to your account manager or to the support team.
